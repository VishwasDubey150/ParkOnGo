# ParkOnGo

ParkOnGo is an android application which is used for optimising the parking facilites for users.

## Tech stack 
Kotlin , firebase , Python ,Html ,CSS ,JavaScript ,SQL.

## Idea
- We will connect parking lot owners and vehicle users facilitating in prebooking parking spots before one arrives at the destination thus catering users' convenience and saving their time.​
- Users will have many options of parking areas to choose from, preventing them from choosing illegal on-street parking and thus avoiding road congestions.​

- Vehicles will beforehand have a place to get parked thus decreasing the emissions emitted when searching for a parking spot.​

- Prices of parking slots will be decided with consent of the parking operators and all parking options of different price range will be projected on the app.​
